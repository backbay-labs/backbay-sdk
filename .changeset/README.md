# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

**What is a changeset?** A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds three bits of information:

- What packages need to be released
- What semver bump type should be applied (major / minor / patch)
- A summary of the change

Run `bunx changeset` to create a new changeset.
